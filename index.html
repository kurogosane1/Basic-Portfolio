		<p> I graduated with a Bachelors in Accounting. I spent three years working as an accountant and then realized that accounting was not meant for me and desired creativity. 
		</p>
	
		<p> Deep inside I love art and in every availble free time would take the opportunity to learn art on my own. With Tecnology improving every day, even developing a webpage is now a work of art. It requires creativity and analysis that I wanted to see applied in my career. 
		</p>
	
		<p> I learnt about UT Austin Bootcamp and immediately knowing there part-time learning class scope, I decided to take the plunge and you can see the fruits from it.
